    As a Cloud Architect for Instabase, I work with customers, Sales Engineers, and Engineering to ensure that the Instabase platform can be deployed in both customer environments and in our managed SaaS platform.
    I enable customers to deploy the Instabase platform as a complex, scalable, cloud native Kubernetes application. This includes integrating all aspects of infrastructure and support for machine learning (ML), model training, and large language models (LLMs). In addition, I work with customers to integrate our solutions into their upstream and downstream systems and act as a customer advocate to drive internal change to better meet our customers' needs.
    Internally, I support our go to market team and sales engineers to understand complex, multi-discipline challenges that customers might face in implementing or integrating the Instabase platform in their environments.
    To better enable scale, I produce internal and external documentation on topics of infrastructure, deployment, integration, and CI/CD pipelines.
    I have also developed tooling for CI/CD integrations in python, infrastructure as code in terraform, and various scripts in bash.

    My technical role was to support strategic pursuits and deals across the entire company.

    Supporting these large deals required interaction with customers at various levels, from CIO and IT leadership to individual technical contributors. I further interacted with members of Azure Global Engineering, Microsoft Finance, and Sales Leadership to advocate for the customers' technical requirements as well as to bring agreement between Microsoft and the customer for a cloud migration plan going forward.
