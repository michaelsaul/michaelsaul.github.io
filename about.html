<h2 class="section-heading">At Home</h2>

<p>While not a California native, my heart is very much connected to the Golden State. My family and I spent time running on the beach, in the water, on the waves in a sailboat, and generally taking advantage of the year-round outdoor lifestyle.</p>
<p>Since 2022, my family and I have lived in Paris, France. It has been an exciting once in a lifetime opportunity.</p>
<p>My other hobbies include 3d printing, running, and eating my way through France.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">At Work</h2>

<p>I have spent my career finding ways to apply technology solutions to a broad variety of challenges. 
  My passion is for discovering new technologies and leveraging them in creative ways to solve real world challenges.</p>

  <p>At various points, I have supported fighting robots, the now defunct mortgage industry, marketing and entertainment, and the application of open-source software and cloud infrastructure. 
Today, I take those experiences and combine them with new technologies available in the marketplace. 
My superpower is to take these new technologies and to translate them into easy-to-understand solutions.</p>

<p>My current interest is in applied AI and Large Launguage Models (LLMs). Much like how we moved from direct programming of computers to graphical user interfaces, I believe that language will be the next level of interaction with technology. It will allow a whole new generation to take advantage of their technology in ways that was previoulsy only accessible to programmers who had spent years studying.</p>
