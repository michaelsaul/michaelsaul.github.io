<p/>Hi there, and welcome to my little part of the interwebs.</p>

<p>During the day, I am a Cloud and Data Center Technical Solution Architect. Cisco pays me to keep my head in the clouds. Right now I work with Enterprise Customers across Southern California, but if anyone is building the next big tech idea in the South Pacific, please get in touch with me.</p>

<p>I am a lover of all things Tiki, especially a well made Navy Grog or Mai Tai. Every weekend, you can find me running along the beach, or taking to the water in a sailboat.</p>
