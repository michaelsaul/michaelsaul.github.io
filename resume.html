  <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>
  <p>I have spent my career finding ways to apply technology solutions to a broad variety of challenges. My passion is for discovering new technologies and leveraging them in creative ways to solve real world challenges.</p>
  <p>At various points, I have supported fighting robots, the now defunct mortgage industry, marketing and entertainment, and the application of open-source software and cloud infrastructure. Today, I take those experiences and combine them with new technologies available in the marketplace. My superpower is to take these new technologies and to translate them into easy-to-understand solutions.</p> -->
